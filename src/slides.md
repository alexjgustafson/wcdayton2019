# Democratize Publishing

> In 2018, the mission of ‚ÄúDemocratize Publishing‚Äù to me means that people of all backgrounds, interests, and abilities should be able to access Free-as-in-speech software that empowers them to express themselves on the open web and to own their content.

![The Content Mesh ](https://wp.widget.pet/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/three-website-revolutions-1-e1551496187322.png)

<cite>["Delivering Modern Website Experiences: The Journey to a Content Mesh"](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-10-04-journey-to-the-content-mesh/) by Sam Bhagwat, Gatsby Co-founder</cite>

# Blazingly Fast Freedom

Using WordPress and Gatsby to make modern websites that everyone loves.

---

# 2. Setup

The goal is to store our data in a live WordPress site that our Gatsby app can fetch and build upon.

---

# WordPress

- Hosted anywhere, but the REST API needs to be public
- Consider using a subdomain
- WordPress.com or self-hosted WordPress
- Avoid adding any plugins at first unless their main goal is *data*

---

# WordPress

# Install a Gatsby Dev Environment

- Node
- NPM
- Git
- Gatsby CLI [(documentation)](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli)
- Choose a Gatsby Starter at [gatsbyjs.org/starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/)

Here's a starter for WordPress to try things out: [https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-starter-wordpress/](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-starter-wordpress/)

---

# gatsby-starter-wordpress nit pick

Make sure your WP site has at least one post and it has a tag

---

# gatsby-source-wordpress settings

Edit `gatsby-config.js` and change baseUrl

- Gatsby Themes and ports of WordPress themes
